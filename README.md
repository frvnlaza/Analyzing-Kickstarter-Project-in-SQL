**The Goal**

In the context of this project, we take on the role of a data analyst at a startup. The product team is considering launching a campaign on Kickstarter to test the viability of some offerings. Our task is to pull data that will help the team understand what might influence the success of a campaign. In addition to addressing the specified questions below, a supplementary objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in basic SQL.


Concretely, we try to unravel the answer to the following question:
- What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
- Which projects fail?
