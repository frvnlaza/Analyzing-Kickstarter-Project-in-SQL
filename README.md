For this guided project, I'll take on the role of a data analyst at a startup. The product team is
considering launching a campaign on Kickstarter to test the viability of some offerings. I've been
asked to pull data that will help the team understand what might influence the success of a
campaign.

We'll answer the following questions:
  What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
  Which projects fail?
